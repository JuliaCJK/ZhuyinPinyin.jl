# ZhuyinPinyin.jl
![Unit Tests](https://github.com/tmthyln/ZhuyinPinyin.jl/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)

Simple Julia package for converting between zhuyin and pinyin pronunciation representations. This package just exports 2 functions: `to_zhuyin` and `to_pinyin`.

See the [documentation](https://tmthyln.github.io/ZhuyinPinyin.jl/latest/) for a bit more detail on the behavior on these functions.
